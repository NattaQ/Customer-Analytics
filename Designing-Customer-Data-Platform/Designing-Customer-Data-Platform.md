# Customer Single View

A Customer Single View (CSV), also known as a 360-degree view of the customer, is a comprehensive and consolidated representation of all the data and interactions a business has with a particular customer. It provides a holistic perspective on the customer's behavior, preferences, transactions, and engagement across various touchpoints and channels. This unified view allows businesses to better understand their customers, personalize interactions, and make informed decisions.

Here's an example of designing a CSV for a fashion clothing shop.

Initially, the collected data we are able to obtain might include basic information, as shown in the table below.

Table 1 : Topic of Basic Data

| Column Name  | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| customer_id  | Customer's ID  |
| customer_age | Customer's age |
| customer_gender | Customer's gender |
| time_shop | Date & Time customer purchase |
| cart_id | Cart's ID |
| cart_size | L=Large, M=Medium, S=Small |
| spending | Total spending of a cart |

Then we able to transform to get more insight information per below.

Table 2 : Customer Single View

| Features  | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| customer_id  | Customer's ID  |
| customer_age | Customer's age |
| customer_gender | Customer's gender |
| total_spend | Total Spending of a Customer |
| first_time_shop | First date purchase whcih get from "time_shop" |
| last_time_shop | Last date purchase whcih get from "time_shop" |
| shop_times | How many times customer purchased by count cart_id |
| frequenct | How offent customer purchased by calculate from (shop_times/timeframe) |
| lifetime | How long they become our customer by calculate from (last_time_shop - first_time_shop) |
| Average Spending per Transaction | Average Spending per Transaction of a customer by calculate from (total_spend/shop_times)|


After that, we able to use Table 2 to do Customer Segmentaion for finding customer insight and allows businesses to better understand their customers, personalize interactions, and make informed decisions.
