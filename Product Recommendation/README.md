# Product Recommendation

This topic we're takling about Product Recommendation.

Traditional recommendation systems have employed Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF). 
CBF recommends items to a user based on the features or attributes of the items with which they have previously interacted. 
It matches the user's profile with item characteristics to provide recommendations. On the other hand, CF suggests items to a user based on the preferences and behaviors of other users who share similar tastes. 
It identifies patterns by analyzing interactions between users and items, such as ratings, likes, or purchase history.

But this time we will use CBF Technique to do Product Recommendation.
