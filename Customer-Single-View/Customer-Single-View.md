# Customer-Single-View

Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), also known as Customer LTV or CLV, is a metric that calculates the total revenue a business can expect to generate from a single customer throughout their entire relationship with the company. It's a valuable metric for understanding the long-term value of a customer and guiding strategic decisions related to customer acquisition, retention, and marketing strategies.

CLTV takes into account the customer's purchase history, buying frequency, average order value, and the duration of their relationship with the business. It helps businesses identify high-value customers, allocate resources effectively, and tailor marketing efforts to different customer segments.

Here's a simplified example of how to calculate Customer Lifetime Value:

Suppose you're running an online subscription-based streaming service. You have a customer, Alex, who has been subscribed for 2 years. During these 2 years, Alex has made the following transactions:

Year 1: Alex paid $10 per month for 12 months.
Year 2: Alex paid $12 per month for 12 months.
To calculate Alex's CLTV, you can use the following formula:

CLTV = (Average Monthly Revenue) x (Average Customer Lifespan)

Where:

Average Monthly Revenue = (Total Revenue from Transactions) / (Total Number of Months)
Average Customer Lifespan = (Total Duration of Relationship) / (Total Number of Customers)
Calculations:

Total Revenue from Transactions = (12 months * $10) + (12 months * $12) = $240 + $144 = $384
Total Number of Months = 24 months
Total Number of Customers = 1 (since we're calculating for one customer)
Average Monthly Revenue = $384 / 24 = $16
Average Customer Lifespan = 24 months / 1 = 24 months
Now, calculate CLTV:
CLTV = $16 (Average Monthly Revenue) x 24 (Average Customer Lifespan) = $384

So, in this simplified example, Alex's Customer Lifetime Value is $384. This means that, on average, Alex is expected to generate $384 in revenue over the entire duration of their relationship with the streaming service.

In reality, CLTV calculations can be more complex, considering factors like customer churn rate, discounting, and retention efforts. However, this example illustrates the basic concept of how CLTV is calculated and its importance in assessing customer value.
